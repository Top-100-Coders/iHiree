### Custom GitHub Analysis Script Contribution

As part of my contributions to the iHire project, I developed a custom GitHub analysis script. This script, available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arfazkhan/skillscluptor), enhances iHire's capabilities by providing a detailed analysis of candidates' GitHub profiles. This contribution aims to empower users with insights into candidates' coding skills, project contributions, and collaborative abilities, thereby strengthening the overall assessment process.
